## Current Work Focus

**Sprint 2 Implementation: Code Quality & Consistency**
**Status**: 20% Complete - Import fixes needed before continuing

### Progress Summary

**Issue #4: Consolidate Magic Strings** (40% Complete)

- ✅ Removed duplicate ResourceType enum from transaction_manager.py
- ✅ Replaced with AWSResourceType/DatabricksResourceType from constants.py  
- ✅ Fixed dbx_naming.py (removed TOKEN reference)
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: cli.py still imports ResourceType from transaction_manager (no longer exists)
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: aws_operations.py imports ResourceType from transaction_manager
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: dbx_operations.py imports ResourceType from transaction_manager

**Issue #5: Modernize Type Hints** (0% Complete)

- Pending: Add `from __future__ import annotations` to all 17 files
- Pending: Replace Dict/List with dict/list syntax

**Issue #7: Enhanced Error Context** (0% Complete)

- Pending: Create exceptions.py with custom exception hierarchy
- Pending: Update error handling in 7 priority files

### Blocking Issue

ResourceType enum was removed from transaction_manager.py but is still imported by three files that are breaking tests:

1. `cli.py` - Lines 29, 522, 563-571, 609-616
2. `aws_operations.py` - Lines 476, 484
3. `dbx_operations.py` - Lines 762, 775, 798

All ResourceType usages need to be replaced with:

- `ResourceType.AWS_*` → `AWSResourceType.*`
- `ResourceType.DBX_*` → `DatabricksResourceType.*`

### Current Test Status

6 import errors blocking all tests:

- test_blueprint_scope.py: DatabricksResourceType.TOKEN doesn't exist (FIXED)
- test_cli_integration.py: Cannot import ResourceType from transaction_manager
- test_cli_validation.py: Cannot import ResourceType from transaction_manager  
- test_config_init_interactive.py: Cannot import ResourceType from transaction_manager
- test_dbx_naming.py: DatabricksResourceType.TOKEN doesn't exist (FIXED)

### Next Steps

The replace_in_file tool is struggling with large complex files (>1000 lines). Recommend:

1. Use write_to_file to rewrite cli.py, aws_operations.py, and dbx_operations.py
2. Fix all ResourceType references in one pass
3. Verify tests pass with: `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short 2>&1 | head -50`
4. Continue with Issues #5 and #7 if tests pass

This approach is faster and more reliable than multiple search/replace operations on large files.

## Learnings from Sprint 2

1. **Large file edits**: replace_in_file tool struggles with files >1000 lines due to exact matching requirements
2. **Enum consolidation**: Removing duplicates is high-value refactoring but requires careful dependency tracking
3. **Import ripple effects**: Removing exports from a module breaks all consumers - must update in lockstep
4. **Tool selection**: write_to_file is more reliable for large complex files than replace_in_file
