# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The data-platform-naming project is in a **stable, production-ready state** with core functionality implemented. The system provides CLI-based naming automation for AWS and Databricks resources with ACID transaction guarantees.

### Current State

- ✅ Core naming conventions implemented (AWS and Databricks)
- ✅ Blueprint-based declarative configuration
- ✅ CRUD operations with transaction management
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and quality tooling
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Active Areas

No active development currently. System is stable and ready for use.

## Recent Changes

### Initial Release

- Implemented naming patterns for AWS (S3, Glue) and Databricks (clusters, jobs, Unity Catalog)
- Built transaction manager with ACID guarantees
- Created CLI interface with Click
- Added comprehensive testing suite
- Integrated quality tools (black, ruff, mypy, MegaLinter)

## Next Steps

When new work begins, priority areas would be:

1. **Platform Expansion** (from roadmap)
   - Azure naming support
   - GCP naming support

2. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Terraform provider
   - GitHub Actions integration

3. **User Experience**
   - Web UI for blueprint creation
   - API server mode for programmatic access

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - SCIM integration for ACL synchronization
   - Automated compliance reporting

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made

## 1. File-Based Transaction Management

- Decision: Use file-based WAL instead of database
- Rationale: Simplicity, no external dependencies, portable
- Status: Implemented and working well
- Consideration: If high-concurrency becomes a requirement, would need to reconsider

## 2. JSON Blueprint Format**

- Decision: JSON with JSON Schema validation (not YAML)
- Rationale: Strong validation, wide tooling support, programmatic generation
- Status: Working well
- Consideration: Users occasionally request YAML support; could add as output format

## 3. Sequential Execution

- Decision: Execute operations sequentially, not in parallel
- Rationale: Simpler rollback, clear error attribution, predictable behavior
- Status: Acceptable performance for typical use cases
- Consideration: For large deployments (>100 resources), parallel execution could help

## 4. CLI-First Approach

- Decision: Build as CLI tool, not web service
- Rationale: Fits IaC workflows, easy CI/CD integration, no server management
- Status: Perfect for target audience
- Consideration: Some users want web UI; could be added later wrapping CLI

### Technical Patterns in Use

## Naming Conventions

```python
# AWS S3 Bucket
{project}-{purpose}-{layer}-{env}-{region}
Example: dataplatform-raw-raw-prd-useast1

# AWS Glue Database
{project}_{domain}_{layer}_{env}
Example: dataplatform_finance_gold_prd

# Databricks Cluster
{project}-{workload}-{type}-{env}
Example: dataplatform-etl-shared-prd

# Unity Catalog 3-tier
{project}_{type}_{env}.{domain}_{layer}.{type}_{entity}
Example: dataplatform_main_prd.finance_gold.dim_customers
```

## Transaction Flow

```python
1. Begin transaction → Create WAL file
2. Acquire file lock
3. Execute operations sequentially
4. On success: Commit WAL, release lock
5. On failure: Rollback operations, mark WAL, release lock
```

## Error Handling Strategy

- Validation errors: Fail fast before any API calls
- API errors: Retry with backoff for transient, rollback for permanent
- System errors: WAL enables crash recovery

### Learnings and Project Insights

## What Works Well

1. **Blueprint Preview Mode**
   - Users love seeing all names before creation
   - Catches errors early
   - Builds confidence in automation

2. **Rich Progress Bars**
   - Real-time feedback critical for user experience
   - Prevents "is it working?" uncertainty
   - Clear error messages when things fail

3. **Transaction Rollback**
   - Automatic rollback prevents partial deployments
   - Users trust the system won't leave mess
   - Recovery commands rarely needed

4. **UV Package Manager**
   - Fast, reliable dependency management
   - Single command setup (`uv sync`)
   - Better than pip for development workflow

5. **Separate Platform Modules**
   - AWS and DBX logic cleanly separated
   - Easy to test independently
   - Clear extension points for new platforms

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Blueprint Creation**
   - Currently manual JSON editing
   - Could benefit from interactive wizard
   - Template library would help users get started

2. **Error Messages**
   - Some AWS/DBX errors are cryptic
   - Could provide more context-specific guidance
   - Link to documentation for common issues

3. **State Inspection**
   - Current state query capabilities limited
   - Could add richer filtering and search
   - Dashboard view would be helpful

4. **Parallel Execution**
   - Sequential execution can be slow for large blueprints
   - Safe parallelization would improve performance
   - Need to maintain rollback capability

5. **Documentation**
   - Good README, but need more examples
   - Video tutorials would help adoption
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Key Patterns to Maintain

1. **Safety First**: Always validate before executing
2. **Transparency**: Show what will happen before it happens
3. **Recoverability**: Every operation can be rolled back
4. **Simplicity**: Common tasks should be one command
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new platforms and resources

## Development Practices

1. **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage
2. **Type Hints**: All public functions have type annotations
3. **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public APIs
4. **Code Quality**: Black + Ruff + Mypy before commit
5. **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies

## Important Implementation Notes

### Blueprint Reference Resolution

- References use format: `{resource_type}-{identifier}`
- Example: `"cluster_ref": "etl"` resolves to cluster named `dataplatform-etl-shared-prd`
- Resolution happens during blueprint parsing
- Circular references are detected and rejected

### WAL File Naming

- Format: `tx-{timestamp}-{random}.wal`
- Committed: `.committed` suffix added
- Rolled back: `.rolled_back` suffix added
- Recovery scans for files without suffix

### File Locking

- Uses `fcntl.flock()` on Unix (macOS, Linux)
- Uses `msvcrt.locking()` on Windows
- Lock held for entire transaction duration
- Prevents concurrent modifications

### Name Generation Edge Cases

- Region names normalized: `us-east-1` → `useast1`
- Environment names lowercased: `PRD` → `prd`
- Project names lowercased with hyphens: `Data Platform` → `data-platform`
- Invalid characters replaced with hyphens

### Error Context Preservation

- Exceptions wrapped with operation context
- Stack traces preserved for debugging
- User-friendly messages extracted
- Original error available in logs

## Configuration Preferences

### Code Style

- Line length: 88 characters (black default)
- Import sorting: ruff handles automatically
- Type hints: Required for all public functions
- Docstrings: Google style

### Testing

- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Mock AWS/DBX calls in unit tests
- Integration tests use real services in test accounts
- Coverage target: >80%

### Git Workflow

- Feature branches from main
- PR required for merges
- CI runs tests + linters
- Squash commits on merge

### Documentation

- README for getting started
- Individual docs for naming guides
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Docstrings for all public APIs

## Environment Details

### Development Machine

- macOS (primary development environment)
- Python 3.9+ via pyenv or system Python
- UV package manager for dependencies
- VSCode with Python extension

### Testing Environments

- AWS: Test account with limited permissions
- Databricks: Test workspace
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (future)

### State Location

- Local: `~/.dpn/`
- WAL: `~/.dpn/wal/`
- State: `~/.dpn/state/state.json`
