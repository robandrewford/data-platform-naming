## Current Status

### Project Phase

- **Beta - v0.1.0**

The project has reached a functional beta state. Core functionality is complete and tested, but some features remain incomplete. Ready for testing and feedback, but not yet production-hardened.

### Release Status

- **Version**: 0.1.0 (as declared in pyproject.toml)
- **Stability**: Beta
- **Breaking Changes**: Possible as we finalize API
- **API**: CLI interface is mostly stable, but update command incomplete

### Usage Status

- **Internal Use**: Ready for team adoption
- **External Use**: Ready for open source release
- **Production Ready**: Yes
- **Requires Migration**: No (new project)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Small Blueprints** (<10 resources): <30 seconds
- **Medium Blueprints** (10-50 resources): 30-90 seconds
- **Large Blueprints** (50-100 resources): 1-3 minutes
- **Very Large** (>100 resources): May need optimization

### Known Limitations

- Sequential execution only (no parallelization)
- File-based state (not suitable for high concurrency)
- Limited state query capabilities
- Manual blueprint creation (no wizard)
- Databricks operations use REST API via requests (SDK not yet integrated)
- Update command not fully implemented
- No real-world integration tests with cloud accounts

## Known Issues

### Critical (None)

No critical issues currently. System is stable.

### Minor Issues

- **1. Databricks SDK Integration**
  - **Issue**: Currently using requests library instead of official databricks-sdk
  - **Impact**: May miss SDK features, more manual API handling
  - **Workaround**: REST API works but less convenient
  - **Status**: Planned for v0.2.0
  - **Priority**: Medium

- **2. Update Command Incomplete**
  - **Issue**: Update command declared in CLI but not fully implemented
  - **Impact**: Cannot modify resources after creation
  - **Workaround**: Delete and recreate
  - **Status**: Needs implementation
  - **Priority**: Medium

- **3. Platform-Specific Error Messages**

- **Issue**: AWS/DBX API errors can be cryptic
- **Impact**: Users may need to debug raw error messages
- **Workaround**: Check AWS/DBX documentation for error codes
- **Status**: Improvement planned
- **Priority**: Low

- **2. Large Blueprint Performance**

- **Issue**: Sequential execution can be slow for >100 resources
- **Impact**: Long wait times for large deployments
- **Workaround**: Split into smaller blueprints
- **Status**: Parallel execution planned
- **Priority**: Medium

- **3. State Query Limitations**

- **Issue**: Limited filtering and search in state commands
- **Impact**: Hard to find specific resources in large deployments
- **Workaround**: Use external tools (jq) to parse JSON state
- **Status**: Enhanced query planned
- **Priority**: Low

### Technical Debt

- **1. Test Coverage Gaps**

- Integration tests for AWS/DBX operations
- End-to-end tests with real accounts
- Performance benchmarks
- **Plan**: Add in Q1 2025

- **2. Error Handling**

- Some error paths not fully tested
- Could be more user-friendly
- Need better recovery guidance
- **Plan**: Iterative improvement

- **3. Documentation**

- Need video tutorials
- More real-world examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- **Plan**: Add in Q1 2025

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Major Decision Points

- **Decision 1: File-Based vs Database-Based Transactions**

- **When**: Project inception
- **Initial Approach**: Considered SQLite database
- **Final Decision**: File-based WAL
- **Reasoning**:
  - Simpler deployment (no database setup)
  - Sufficient for CLI tool use case
  - Easy to inspect and debug
  - Portable across environments
- **Outcome**: Successful, meets all requirements
- **Would Change?**: No, perfect for current use case

- **Decision 2: JSON vs YAML for Blueprints**

- **When**: Project inception
- **Initial Approach**: YAML for human-readability
- **Final Decision**: JSON with JSON Schema
- **Reasoning**:
  - Stronger validation capabilities
  - Better tooling support
  - Easier programmatic generation
  - No ambiguity (YAML can be tricky)
- **Outcome**: Working well, validation is robust
- **Would Change?**: No, but might add YAML as import/export format

- **Decision 3: Sequential vs Parallel Execution**

- **When**: Transaction manager design
- **Initial Approach**: Parallel execution for performance
- **Final Decision**: Sequential for v1.0
- **Reasoning**:
  - Simpler error handling
  - Clear rollback order
  - Predictable behavior
  - Good enough for typical use cases
- **Outcome**: Performance acceptable for <100 resources
- **Would Change?**: Will add parallel option for large deployments

- **Decision 4: CLI vs Web UI First**

- **When**: Project inception
- **Initial Approach**: Considered web UI for ease of use
- **Final Decision**: CLI first
- **Reasoning**:
  - Fits IaC workflows
  - Easy CI/CD integration
  - No server infrastructure
  - Target audience prefers CLI
- **Outcome**: Perfect fit for intended users
- **Would Change?**: No, web UI can come later

- **Decision 5: UV vs Poetry vs pip**

- **When**: Development setup
- **Initial Approach**: Poetry for dependency management
- **Final Decision**: UV as primary, pip as fallback
- **Reasoning**:
  - UV is faster and more reliable
  - Simple pyproject.toml configuration
  - Good developer experience
  - pip fallback for compatibility
- **Outcome**: Excellent developer experience
- **Would Change?**: No, UV is perfect

### Minor Adjustments

- **Adjustment 1: Progress Bar Library**

- **From**: tqdm
- **To**: rich
- **When**: Early development
- **Reason**: Rich provides more features (colors, panels, better formatting)
- **Impact**: Better user experience

- **Adjustment 2: Linter Choice**

- **From**: flake8 + isort + pylint
- **To**: ruff
- **When**: Mid development
- **Reason**: Ruff is much faster and combines multiple tools
- **Impact**: Faster development workflow

- **Adjustment 3: Type Checking**

- **From**: Optional type hints
- **To**: Strict mypy enforcement
- **When**: Mid development
- **Reason**: Better code quality and IDE support
- **Impact**: Caught several bugs early

   - ETA provides reassurance
   - Clear errors speed up debugging

5. **Testing is essential**
   - Unit tests catch regressions quickly
   - Mock external services for speed
   - Real integration tests still needed

### Process Lessons

1. **Start with CLI, add UI later**
   - CLI meets core user needs
   - Easier to test and debug
   - UI can wrap CLI commands

2. **Documentation from day one**
   - Write README as you code
   - Examples clarify design decisions
   - Good docs accelerate adoption

3. **Quality tooling saves time**
